    # How to Run my [College Project](https://github.com/KrishnaBishowkarma/CollegeProject)

    ## Prerequisites
    - Git installed on your machine: [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari)

    ## Steps to Run the Project

    1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/KrishnaBishowkarma/CollegeProject.git
     ```

    2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Change your directory to the project folder using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd CollegeProject
     ```

    3. **Open the Website**
   - Once you are in the project directory, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
     - You can use the following command in the terminal to open it:
       ```bash
       open index.html
       ```
     - Alternatively, you can manually open the file by navigating to the project folder and double-clicking on `index.html`.

    4. **Explore the Website**
   - The website should now be open in your web browser. You can navigate through different pages and interact with the content.

    ## Troubleshooting
